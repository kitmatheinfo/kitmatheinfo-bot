This is a custom-built Discord bot for the https://kitmatheinfo.de/ community. The bot is tailored to provide specific features which aren't covered by existing solutions. It might therefore not be particularly useful for the general public.

# Features
* Information board, using buttons to reduce clutter from overly long walls of text.
* Multi role assignments, using dropdown menus
* User-managed channel category. Empowering users to create their own channel, to discuss whatever they feel needs its own channel.
* Written in Rust using [poise](https://github.com/kangalioo/poise) and [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity). The kids love things written in Rust, so I was told.

# How to run
First, you need a compiled version of the source. You can either build the source by yourself using `cargo` or use the provided docker images. The binary requires exactly one argument, which is the path to the configuration file. (See [config.example.toml](config.example.toml) for sample configuration file.)
